            <dt></dt>
            <dd> An active job seeker is always valuable asset to a recruiting company. Any data collected from a job candidate will notice system admin. </br>
                a Job candidate can click the link from a online job board or the recruiting company’s website which will lead the candidate to the DiscoveryCRM’s profile creating form.</br>
                The candidate can fill out each required sections by himself or parse the resume that he already have in his storage.</br>

                If a candidate is not actively looking for a job but wish to update his or her resume in DiscoveryCRM’s database,</br>
                a job candidate may visit a recruiting company’s website and apply to the ‘any job’ opening. This will lead the candidate to profile creating UI.</br>
                When a candidate creates his profile in the DiscoveryCRM, the system must check candidates first and last name, email, phone number and zipcode not to be blank.</br>
