John is a recruiter working at a staffing consulting company called PeopleSearch.</br>
    John’s co-worker Adam works at the same company as system administrator. When Adam receives descriptions about an open position from an account manager he creates a job requirement in a database.</br>
    He can post new job requirements to PeopleSearch’s web site and popular online job boards.</br>
    If a job seeker applies to the newly posted job opening, DiscoverCRM’s parsing module parses the resume and reconcile module will check the job candidate application data for likely duplication.</br>
    The system will alert Adam so he can send the parsed resume to the recruiter John.</br>
    when John starts his day, he may have candidates from Adam. After he calls all candidates from Adam, he searches more possible candidates in  DiscoveryCRM’s database.</br>
    If he runs out of all candidates then he searches online job boards’ resume database.</br>
    When John finds a good fit, he parses the resume into DiscoveryCRM.</br>
    Parsing module parses the resume and shows possible duplication based on new resumes attributes, currently name and email.</br>
    John can decide update existing profile if he finds the resume is already existed or create a new profile. Even though he created duplication,</br>
    A.I. checker will find duplicates and merge the two profiles.</br>
