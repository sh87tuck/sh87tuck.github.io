<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
 As a team, Seunghyuk Baek and Thomas Estabrook have designed a high-level design of a customer relationship management system called DiscoveryCRM for the recruitment industry. The CRM is a SaaS or native system product providing data processing and reconciliation to decrease recruiters resume searching effort. 

   This idea originates from Seunghyuk’s daily work with Bullhorn crm. Bullhorn provides duplication checking but its accuracy is depending on candidate's’ name and contact information. For example, if one tries to parse the resume of a person name John Adams, Bullhorn will warn a user to check existing leads whose name is Johnson Adams or Johnny Adams. In addition, Bullhorn links the Linkedin page of a specific candidate but does not actively search of a candidate. Architectural choices will matter in the implementation of the system because the data types have dependency on external sources of data. The data sets primarily reside in web facing databases and must be prepared carefully by the extraction, loading, and transformation process in order to be consumed by the application. 

   The result of the design will accept a job description and a resume of expected candidate as an input then provide automated reports including possible candidates from outer source such as Facebook or LInkedin.com. The key factor of successful implementation of this system is speed and accuracy. An example use case would be applied when the system found one candidate from LInkedin.com. The candidate’s resume would be checked for duplication before it is committed then would be parsed into the database. Use of primary storage to quickly evaluate match data will be considered to reduce discovery times. The benefit and usefulness to the users of DiscoveryCRM is the reduction in the amount of the tedious candidate searching process. Freeing up more time for acquisition activities.
